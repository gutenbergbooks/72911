1789, from the Island of Barbadoes, sent in plants, by Mr. J. Elcock, to
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith. Originally this shrub was
specifically termed, <i>parasitica</i> by professor Jacquin, when he first
formed, and titled the Genus, after Dr. J. Hill, of voluminous memory;
from a supposition that it was to be found growing, only, upon some
other plant; a circumstance, which being denied by Swartz, he has
altered it to <i>longiflora</i>. We have followed the latter name that ours
may go in unison with the author of the last Species plantarum now
publishing by Willdenow, as well as professor Martyn, who in his edition
of Miller’s Dictionary has followed Swartz; they appearing to be the
most accurate, as well as the most read and followed of any modern
Botanical authorities. It is a tender hot-house plant, strikes easily
from cuttings, thrives in rich mould and flowers about the end of
February. To the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Valentia we are indebted, for
the specimen from which our figure was taken, sent from his Lordship’s
famed collection at Arley near Bewdley, Staffordshire; where, we
believe, it has flowered for the first time in England.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

learn from the Catalogue, in the year 1774. But although so long a
sojourner with us, it is not found in many collections, owing to the
difficulty in its increase, as it seldom ripens its seeds; and cuttings,
the only remaining method, but seldom succeed; although by taking them
from a vigorous growing plant and giving them the assistance of the
bark-bed of the hothouse, early in March, a few plants have been
procured occasionally. Our drawing was made from a most beautiful plant
in the Clapham Collection, last year, in the month of August.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

Hope, sent in bulbs to them by J. Pringle, Esq. It is as hardy as the L.
tricolor, to which it much inclines, well known to collectors, and is
equally easily propagated; an excellent figure of which is to be found,
in the 82d Plate of the Botanical Magazine of Mr. Curtis. The L.
quadricolor is given as a synonym by Willdenow to L. pendula, a plant we
have already figured, and from which this stands quite distinct in the
conformation of every part; they are both to be found in the 2d Vol. of
Icon. of Jacquin, from whom we copy our specific title, the pendula, t.
400, the quadricolor, t. 396.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

rather less difficulty it is increased and preferred than the red

of August, at which season, last year, our drawing was taken from a

<p>About the year 1763, this plant was first raised in Britain, from seeds
which had been received from the Island of Madeira, by Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy, Hammersmith. It forms one of the most decorative and
conspicuous plants, either in the Conservatory, or Green-house; and if
encouraged in its growth, by being planted in the border of the one; or
kept in rich earth, in a large pot in the other, will attain the height
of from 6 to 8 feet. The finest specimen we believe, in England, of this
plant is to be found in the elegant Conservatory of the Right Honourable
Lord R. Spencer, Woolbedding, Sussex. The flowers, which grow in
clusters from the ends of the branches in May, have the flavour of
Jasmine; but are rather transitory. It is propagated but slowly and with
difficulty, as it does not perfect its seeds with us, and it is not to
be increased by laying: the only method is cuttings, which should be
taken whilst very young and tender from the plant, about April, and put
from 6 to 8 in a pot, fixed very tight, in stiffish loam; they must
remain under a hand-glass on a shady border till Autumn, when they may
be removed into the hot-house and plunged into the bark bed, where they
will begin to grow the ensuing spring.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>As it should seem a determined principle in the inscrutable arrangement
of nature’s productions, to the greater humiliation of our very limited
understandings; that no effort as emanating solely from thence, shall be
perfect; so must we be content to pursue our Botanical travel, under the
guidance of a system decidedly defective; yet certainly, the best we
have to boast. Scarce a genus, comprehending a number of species, but
must be strained in its class or order, for the introduction of one, or
more species, evidently of the same family. So convinced was our great
master of the science, of the impossibility of forming such certain
data, that to prevent the confusion and difficulty, which must have
arisen, from such an accumulation of Genera, if every sexual character
was attended to, that, where certain other characters (called by him
essential, and adopted as a substitute for such occasional hiatus) are
formed, the plant is retained under the Genus so characterised. This
disquisition is the natural result of our examination of the present
plant, which, although the chives are six, is placed in the fifth class!</p>

<p>The Rough-leaved Cordia is a native of the Weft India Islands and was
cultivated, says Martyn’s Dictionary, from Dillenius, in the year 1728,
by Dr. Sherard. It is a tender hot-house plant, may be increased by
cuttings made about the month of April, if kept from too much moisture,
in a pot of sandy loam, under a small striking glass in the bark-bed. At
present it is rather a scarce plant in our collections, and as it is
rather difficult to propagate, is likely to continue so, at least for
some years. From an imported plant, received by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
Hammersmith, from the island of Barbadoes, our figure was taken in the
year 1789, about the month of July. It is grown to the greatest
perfection by keeping it in a mixture of rotten dung and loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

the same time with the white variety, by Mr. Francis Masson, to the
Royal Gardens, Kew, in the year 1795. It is a tender plant, and requires
the heat of the hot-house, through the winter months to preserve it,
being a native of that part of Africa near the Namaqua land, which is in
most parts a barren, arid sand, extremely hot and parched, experiencing
little change through the whole year. The propagation is either produced
by cuttings, or from the roots, which are tuberous, in most instances,
if the plant is kept in light sandy peat earth. The drawing was made, in
March this year, at the Nursery of Mr. J. Colville, King’s Road,
Chelsea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

characters, will, upon inspecting the dissections, appear absolutely
necessary; as the shaft is not bent, in either species we have examined,
whilst the flower is perfect; but assumes that appearance on its decay,
as it becomes involved with the petals, which twist up in the manner of
Morœa, Iris, &amp;c. The Summit likewise, is not funnel-shaped, but merely a
little concave, with a border; other small variations have been made, in
the character of the seed-vessel and seed. In the year 1794, this fine
plant was raised by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, from seeds received by them
from the Cape of Good Hope, where it is native. It is one of the very
hardiest inhabitants of the greenhouse, and is propagated, either from
the seed, which ripens with us; or by the offsets made from the root.
The plant is persistent, but does not acquire a stem; the leaves growing
to the length of from two, to three feet, the flower-stem sometimes to
the height of four feet; which was nearly that of the plant in the
Collection of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham, from which our drawing was taken
in the month of July 1800. It should be planted in sandy peat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

the shape of the threads, on which the essential generical distinction

have not absolutely foot-stalks, they are much larger, above the middle,
than is usual in Hermannia, as may be seen on the plate; where these
parts are shewn, magnified. It has likewise that singularly curious
character, seen in Mahernia, of the two blossoms which terminate the
flower-stems, each taking a contrary direction, in its spiral twist, to
the other. As a greenhouse plant, it is rather tender in regard to damp,
though not to cold; therefore, should be kept in the most airy part of
the house. It is a native of the Cape, from whence it was introduced in
the year 1796, to the Royal Gardens, Kew. By cuttings made in the month
of April, it may be preserved, and increased, as it is not a long-lived
plant. Loam, with a small portion of old rotten dung, it thrives in
most. Our drawing was taken, at the Nursery, Hammersmith, in June 1800.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

lost to us above a century, and but recently introduced to the Oxford
Botanic Garden by the late Dr. Sibthorpe. Being a hardy biennial, it
will perfect its seeds about July, which may be sown in August the same
year. It will grow in any soil, but a sandy compost of light peat and
loam suits it most. The flowers on the spikes, which grow sometimes to
the length of four feet, continue to expand, upwards, for above two
months; that is to say, from April, till June. Our figure was taken from
a specimen sent by the Hon. W. H. Irby, from his garden at the

<p>Even amidst this splendid family, Amaryllis Fothergillia stands
conspicuously preeminent; the flowers have the same vivid character of
refulgence, when exposed to the sun’s rays, which is perceived in A.
Sarniensis, or the Guernsey Lily, to which it is nigh affined. The late
Dr. Fothergill (to whom the botanical world is so much indebted, for the
zeal and extraordinary liberality he constantly manifested, in advancing
the science) received this plant from China at the same time with A.
aurea, A. radiata, &amp;c. about the year 1777. It is rather a scarce and
tender bulb, as it is subject to rot by overmuch wet. It has hitherto
been kept, as are most plants on their first arrival from China, in the
hot-house; but, from every appearance, we should be led to suppose, it
would not perish if kept in the Green-house, as we question much,
whether it is not equally hardy with the Guernsey Lily, and a native,
originally, as well as the latter, of Japan.</p>

<p>It should be planted in sandy loam, with a small quantity of rough peat,
above the tiles in the pot, to make it flower. The propagation is from
offsets, which are produced but rarely from the old bulbs. Our figure
was taken from a plant in the Hammersmith nursery this year, 1801, in

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> shrubby species of Echium was introduced, to the Royal Gardens at

grows to the height of three feet, or more, rather bushy at the top,
flowers about the month of May, and perfects its seeds with us; by which
only method, it is to be propagated. It thrives best in a light loamy
soil, with a small proportion of sandy peat, about one fourth.</p>

<p>Professor Martyn, in his Miller’s Dic. has collated two descriptions of
Echiums under the titles of lævigatum, and glabrum; the first, No. 9,
from Lin. Sp. Plant. 199; the second, No 19, from Vahl. Symb. 3. 22.
Thunberg has likewise, in his Prodromus, 33. two names of plants, as E.
lævigatum, and E. glabrum; from whom Willdenow, in his new Edition of
Sp. Plant, p. 785, has copied them under the same titles; adding, the
various synonyms, from Linnæus’s Sp. Plant, to the one; and to the
latter, Prof. Jacquin’s specific of glaucophyllum, taken from his Ic.
rar. 2. t. 312, and his Collect. 2. p. 325. Now, we have little
hesitation in declaring our opinion, and we think, those who choose to
compare our figure with the different descriptions here mentioned, will
coincide with us, that this is the plant from which they must all have
originated, except the E. glabrum of Vahl, which we take to be a
different plant; as, the cup is described hairy, the length of the tube
of the blossom; the chives longer, and the flower smaller. Wherefore, we
have taken, for our plant, the specific title of Jacquin, as being, in
our idea, the most appropriate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Genus Brunsfelsia (by Plumier so named, in honour of Otho Brunsfels
a monk, the first who edited in 1530 a Botanical work with good figures,
it contained 238 plates) has undergone a very necessary revision since
the days of Linnæus; indeed, it appears singular that Father Plumier,
from whom Linnæus quotes his Generic character, should have committed so
great an oversight, as to describe it with five chives; a feature
scarcely to be expected, from a sport of nature, in plants of this
Class. So however it is on record, and the fifth Class of the Gen. and
Spe. Plant, and of the Syst. Nat. tom. ii. each includes this Genus;
from which, we should be induced to think he had designed some other
plant; if the figure, and the rest of the description, did not confirm
it. Schreber, in his Gen. Plant, has likewise an observation, that the
fruit should be named a capsule, rather than a berry; as given by
Linnæus, Miller, and Swartz; his reason, that it splits determinately,
by a suture, from the top to the base.</p>

<p>Our species, is the third now in Britain; they are all natives of the
West India Islands. The 1st B. americana has been long an inhabitant of
our hothouses; the 2d B. maculata is but little known to most, though
long cultivated here; as it has been treated as a variety of the first
species, notwithstanding the strong specific difference, in the shape of
the leaves and blossoms; which in the B. maculata, are beautifully
marked at the base, and as large as the undulata; the leaves inversely
egg-shaped and more downy. The present plant seldom grows more than four
feet high, flowers freely about March, is very sweet scented, and is
easily propagated by cuttings. It was first sent to England in the year
1784 by Mr. Elcock from the Island of Barbadoes, to Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy, Hammersmith. Our drawing was made from a plant in the Clapham
Collection, in March 1800. It should be planted in rich earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>No Genus of Plants claims our notice, for its beauty, more than
Geranium, and this species, certainly, ranks amongst the foremost. It is
a native of the Cape of Good Hope, and we believe only to be found in
the Clapham Collection; where, our figure was taken in April this year,
from a plant, the bulb or root of which had been received the preceding
autumn. It is nearly the only one, amongst twenty-two species of the
tuberous kind, all having irregular petalled blossoms and tubular cups,
of which we possess drawings, that has seven fertile chives; the greater
number have two, four, or five. It appears to flourish under the
treatment given it by Mr. Allen, which is, by keeping it in sandy peat,
on a shelf, very dry, in the green-house. The propagation appears to be
the same for this, as the other tuberous kinds, that is, by the root.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> coast of Africa bordering on our settlement at Sierra Leone, has
furnished us with a number of beautiful plants; but none more so, than
those of the natural order of Lily; witness our present figure, which
was taken from a plant in the Hammersmith collection, in the month of
August 1800. The bulbs of this grand species of Crinum, were received by
her Ladyship, the Right Honourable the Marchioness of Rockingham, about
the year 1792, from Sierra Leone; they may be considered as hardy
hothouse plants, and may be kept in any part of it; will flower, freely,
about the month of August, the flower-stems rising, sometimes, to the
height of three feet. A mixture, of leaf mould, or sandy peat one half,
and light loam the other, is the best compost to make them flourish. It
is propagated from the seed, or offsets.&mdash;Having made a small
alteration, in the Essential Character of the Genus; and as it is likely
we may figure some other species of Crinums shortly; we think it
necessary to add a few words, to that point. The most ostensible
difference, we have been able to trace, in comparing above 40 species of
Crinums and Amaryllis’s, and on which to rest, with certainty, for
generical distinction; can, unquestionably, be taken only, from the
seeds; as these in most species of Pancratium, Hæmanthus, and all of
this Genus, are viviparous or formed like fleshy bulbs, producing
plants, like offsets taken from the original bulbs. From Pancratium it
is distinct, in being destitute of the Honey-cup; and equally so from
Hæmanthus, which has its sheath of many leaves, the flowers and chives
upright, and the chives, twice the length of the blossoms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

little doubt rests now of its being the A. palmata of Linnæus’s Sp. Pl.
p. 758, and of Vahl, Desfontaines, &amp;c. How the plant could first acquire
the name of palmata, is certainly a mystery; unless it might be, from
the appearance of the fence, which nevertheless but ill accords with
that character. Bauhin’s affination, as Cyclamen-leaved, is certainly
the most appropriate, as the leaves both in shape, and the colour of the
upper and under part, are exact with C. coum. It is rather too delicate
for our winters, if exposed in the open borders; but, makes a pretty
appearance, in spring, if kept in a pot, in light, rich earth. Like most
Anemonies, it propagates best by dividing the roots, which are long and
cylindrical; but, care must be taken not to water the pots, for some
time after planting, as they are apt to rot, where they are broken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1794, this species of Geranium was first introduced to
the Royal Gardens, Kew, by Mr. Francis Masson, from the Cape of Good
Hope. Of all the tuberous kind, this is, certainly, the most specious
yet in England; it flowers generally about March, in which month, our
drawing was made, from a specimen in the nursery of Mr. J. Colville,
King’s Road, Chelsea. Mr. Colville informs us, that the propagation is
very difficult, and only to be performed by the root; as the plant does
not produce any branches, and that the seeds do not ripen; he keeps it
in a mixture of rotten leaves, and sandy peat, in which, it has every
appearance of luxuriant health.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

under the different Genera of Metrosideros, Eucalyptus, Leptospermum,
Myrtus, and this present one of Melaleuca; seem, from what we yet know,
to constitute a very distinguished part, of the woody vegetable
productions of that country: wherefore, we can have little hopes of
seeing many of them flower with us, at least, for many years to come.
The M. ericæfolia was amongst the first plants raised in 1788, by
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, from seeds; but, till this year,
we believe it has not been seen to flower, in any collection in Great
Britain; nor perhaps would it, as yet, had not a large and old plant,
been planted out in the novel and elegant conservatory of the Right Hon.
the Marquis of Blandford at White Knights, near Reading, Berks, from a
branch of which, obligingly communicated by his Lordship, our drawing
was taken, the beginning of July, this year.</p>

<p>The Plant grows to the height of six or seven feet, upright, very
branching, the branches weeping, and the flowers, which grow in spikes
or branches of about six inches in length, project, straight out, from
about the middle of the stem.</p>

<p>It grows best in a mixture of two thirds sandy peat, and one third loam;
may be propagated by cuttings made, from the tender shoots, in the month
of March, and kept under a glass, in the tan bed of the hothouse, or in
a melon frame until rooted.</p>

<p>This species of Melaleuca and the Metrosideros Nodosa of Gaertner, 1st
Vol. de fruct. p. 172, t. 34, f. 6, we must confider as the same, though
made by Dr. Smith, see Linn. Trans. Vol. III. p. 276, distinct species;

species of Cratæva; by whom it was brought to Great Britain, on his
return from Sierra Leone, in the year 1795. As a native of that burning
clime, it will not endure our winters, without the protection of the
hothouse; to which, as a climber, it is a considerable ornament, both in
foliage, and flower; the flowers coming, in succession, from June, till
August; perhaps, much later, as we believe, this is the first time its
blossoms have been produced in England. The propagation is extremely
easy, by cuttings; but, to give the plant sufficient vigour for
flowering, it must be planted in a border, prepared of old rotten dung,
sandy peat, and loam, of each, equal parts; separated from the tan-bed
by a partition of boards, sufficiently strong to support the earth, upon
the removal of the tan. This method of treating many of the tropical
climbers, and even the common Caper, though a native of the south of
Europe, has been found necessary to their production of flowers in this
country. Our figure was taken from a plant, treated in the above manner,
in the Stepney collection; from whence, through the kind indulgence of
the truly urbanic, and indefatigable proprietor, T. Evans, Esq. we are
in hopes of gratifying our botanical friends, with the figures of a
number of plants, new to this country; and of which he is, at present,
the sole possessor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

f. 2. of Swertius’s Florilegium, published in 1612; by F. Hernandez, in
his Nov. Plant. &amp;c. Mex. Hist. p. 276, in 1618; and of Mutis, under the
title it here bears, in his Flo. Amer. 1. t. 15; from whom it has been
copied into the Suppl. Plant. of the younger Linnæus, p. 407. and
continued by Professor Martyn in his Mill. Dic. Art. Ferraria 2. This
Genus, which was originally formed on the Ferraria undulata of the Cape,
and placed to the class Gynandria by Linnæus, has been so continued by
Martyn, &amp;c. but upon what grounds, we are unable to determine; unless
the mistake arose from the impracticability of dividing the tube of the
chives, from the shaft, in a dried specimen; which, in such transitory
flowers as those of Ferraria, Sisyrinchium, Galaxia, &amp;c. all of this
class, seem, in that state, to form a perfect unison. Schreber has
referred these Genera, in his Ed. of Linn. Gen. Plant. to where they
certainly must stand, to Monadelphia. But, although we have continued
the plant under the title by which it is generally known, from an
adherence to our original principle; yet do we think, it equally
necessary to state our opinion, why we consider its generical reference
to have been as ill taken up, as the Genus had been ill classified. This
plant, as may be seen from our dissections, is much nigher affined to
Sisyrinchium, as it wants every essential character of Ferraria, such as
a sheath of one leaf, undulated crisped petals, hooded and fringed
summits, &amp;c. for we do not consider the length of the tube of the
blossom of any moment, as it is not constant. Now, every distinguishing
feature of Sisyrinchium are here extant, viz. a sheath of two leaves,
flat or plain petals, summits neither hooded or fringed; but our figure
will better explain, than words, these strong marked differences. If
indeed we were to give an opinion, it certainly would not be in
coincidence with Thunberg, by placing the whole Genus to Moræa; but to
create a new one from this plant; whose whole structure, but especially
from the Nectaria or honey-cups upon the margin of the inner petals,
stands eminently distinguished from all others.</p>

<p>This most distinguished plant, was first introduced to this country by
Mrs. Hudson of Manchester, about the year 1797; but is now found in most
collections round the Metropolis. It is increased by the seed, which
ripens in this climate, and from the root, which makes abundance of
offsets. The flowers expand in rotation, three or four upon each stem at
the interval of a few days; the stem growing to the height of about two
feet. So very rapid is the progress of the blossom in its decay, from
the time of its opening, which is generally about seven o’clock in the
morning; that before twelve, the lustre is gone, and it is quite decayed
by three, or four. Our drawing was made at the Hammersmith Nursery in
July; and still there were a number of flower stems, which had not, as
yet, made an appearance of flowering. It is best grown in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Amaryllis reticulata, a native of Brazil, South America, was first
cultivated in the year 1772, at the Hammersmith nursery; the bulbs had
been received from Portugal by Edward Whittaker Gray, M.D. of the
British Museum; and were by him communicated to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy.
Our drawing was made this spring, in May, from a plant in the
invaluable, and extensive collection of hothouse plants, at Stepney,
belonging to T. Evans, Esq. where it flowers annually.</p>

<p>To ensure the flowering of this plant, it is necessary to plunge the pot
in the heat of the bark-bed of the hothouse; and, during the winter
months, to keep the earth rather dry, as the bulbs are very subject to
rot, without that precaution. It should be planted in a composition of
old rotten dung, or leaf mould, and a small proportion of loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

and, we think, no one who has had an opportunity of comparing the A.
alpina with this plant, but will determine it a distinct species. It is
a hardy, climbing shrub; growing frequently, eight or ten feet in a
season, and covers itself pretty abundantly with foliage; the
foot-stalks of the old leaves becoming cirrhi or tendrils, and the wood
growing to a considerable thickness. The flowers begin to appear about
May; and continue in succession, till July. It may be propagated by
layers; but, the surest mode is by seed, which may be sown as soon as
ripe, and which will be perfected from the first flowers, by August. It
grows the most flourishing in light rich earth; but will live in the
most common. Our figure was made from a plant in the Hammersmith
collection, to which it was first introduced in the year 1792.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

not many equals; and its property of continuing to flower from June,

the Cape of Good Hope, and was introduced to us, about four years since.
Most collections now possess it, from its facility of increase, may be
planted in rich earth, and is increased by cuttings, or seeds, which
ripen perfectly in this country. The drawing was made at the Nursery,

from Sierra Leone, and must, therefore, be treated as a tender hot-house
plant. It grows, with us, to the height of about two feet before it
flowers; and, from the beauty and size of the leaves, the regular,
opposite manner in which it forms its branches, becomes a very handsome
shrub. The flowers, which are produced in July, grow generally three
together, at right angles, from the insertion of the leaves, in a bunch,
which lasts about six or eight days, having but one flower open and
perfect at a time, the decaying ones becoming brown. It is propagated,
with ease, by cuttings, made in the month of March, and kept under a
bell-glass, in a pot of stiffish loam, in the bark-bed of the hot-house,
or a melon frame. The agreeable character, of a delicate fragrance,
attendant on the blossoms of most species of this genus, is eminently
powerful in this. Our drawing was made at the Hammersmith nursery;
where, it was first raised, from seeds received in a present, by Messrs.
Lee and Kennedy, from the Hon. Sierra Leone Company.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">That</span> a just judgment may be formed, upon what grounds we have taken up a
specific distinction, between the only two species we possess of this
genus; so dissimilar in our opinion, but, which have been considered as
scarcely to be deemed varieties, by much abler botanists than ourselves
profess to be; we have given the figures of both in consequence. Much is
it to be regretted, that the whole natural order of plants forming the
Apocineæ of Jussieu, so charactered in themselves, have not undergone a
proper revision, in classification, upon the original Linnæan sexual
principles; which, we must suppose, have been left in the present
bewildered chaos, from the intricacy, singularity and minuteness of the
parts, being so difficult to develope. From critical and actual
observations, taken from the living plants, we are in hopes of being
able to illustrate, and correct where necessary, the characters of such
as may come under our review.</p>

<p>Upon the changing the class of this genus, there needs no comment; as
most authors seem to allow, though they have not followed the hint, that
it is properly Gynandrous; although they have not equally agreed as to
the Order; some taking the glands, surrounding the summit, for the
chives, and some, for the summits themselves, of a columnar shaft. Dr.
Smith, who has figured our other species, has justly taken, the parts
fixed to the five glands, for what they certainly are; as may be easily
traced through the whole order of Orchideæ, where the chives are nearly
similarly placed and so hooded.</p>

<p>The Genus is by no means new, in name, having been so titled by Linnæus,
from the names of Pergulans and Pergulanus of Burman and Rumphius; who
derived them from the use made of the plants by the natives, of the
western coast of the peninsula of India; where, they are cultivated to
form arbors, for the agreeable flavour of their flowers. This species
was first introduced about the year 1784, by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.
some time before the other species; wherefore, we have given it the
preference. It is propagated by cuttings, and should be treated in the
same manner as directed for the Cratæva capparoides of our last Number,
to have it flower in perfection. The figures of both species were taken,
in August, from two plants in the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington
Gore; where, Mr. Anderson (to whom we must beg our sincere
acknowledgments for his frequent and ready observations and assistance)
informs us, they are treated in such manner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

last, Willdenow. The P. glabra and P. Japonica as our P. minor; and the

bulbs are well rooted, which will be about January, if planted in
October; they may be then put into the heat of a melon or cucumber
frame, or taken into the hothouse, where they will flower about the
latter end of May. This Ixia was first introduced, from Holland, about
the year 1778, under the name of Ixia Kermosina speciosa; and, under
that title, is to be found, in most collections; wherefore, considering
it a distinct species, having drawings of two varieties, we have
continued the specific name of speciosa. Our drawing was made at the
Hammersmith nursery, in May 1799.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

1759, by Millar, in the 7th Edit. of his Dictionary, and from thence,
collated into the Kew Catalogue, p. 289, Vol. I. It is a climbing plant,
if supported; but does not grow to any considerable height, if kept in a
pot. The best method of treating this plant, is the same as that
proposed for the Cratæva capparoides, Pl. 176. Vol. III. The specific
name Suberecta, of Jacquin and Browne, must undoubtedly have been taken
from the plants which grow in the Savannas; where, they seldom acquire
above the height of two feet. The whole plant, from which, if any part
is cut or broken, there issues a milky substance, is considered by Dr.
Browne as poisonous. Our figure was taken at Messrs. Lee and Kennedy’s,

cannot be considered but as a specific character in this particular
species, though the name has its proper force, in contradistinction to
its congeners, in our language. It is a native of Mexico, South America;
and was introduced to our gardens about the year 1789, by Monsʳ Richard,
from the Paris gardens, at the same time with the Virgilia; a most
beautiful annual, of the habit of Arctotis, now lost in both countries
from the difficulty of procuring ripened seeds. It is to be raised in
the same manner as the other species, on a gentle hot-bed, in March, and
planted out the beginning of May. The flowers make their appearance
about the beginning of August, and continue, in succession, till they
are destroyed by the frost. To be certain of the seed, the heads must be
taken from the plant, whilst they appear yet fresh; as the petals are
persistent, and have not the appearance of entire decay, though the seed
is nearly ripe; for if the receptacle once begins to rot, (which it is
very subject to,) the seeds are immediately contaminated and spoilt. Our
figure was taken, this year, at the Hammersmith Nursery, where, it was
grown first in this kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Kew Catalogue we are informed, that this species of Geranium, was
introduced to this country, in the year 1788, by Mr. F. Masson. It is,
like many of this branch of the extended family of Geranium, rather a
tender Green-house plant; and will not flower, in perfection, without
the assistance of the Hot-house. It loses its foliage after flowering,
and remains in a state of inaction for at least three months; during
which period, it should be watered but seldom, and that sparingly. To
propagate it, the only mode is, by cutting small portions of the root
off, and putting them into the strong heat of a hot-bed, about the month
of March; as hitherto, it has not perfected any seeds with us, and the
plant produces no branch, except the flower-stem may be so denominated.
Our drawing was made from the Clapham Collection, in July, this year.
This species has been considered by Professor Martyn, (see his edition
of Mill. Dict. article Pelargonium 2.) as the same with G. pinnatum, and
G. prolificum of Linn. Sp. Plan. But, however, the specific characters
in Linnæus, of those species, may agree with our figure, the G.
Astragalifolium of Jacquin and Cavanilles, they are, unquestionably, all
different plants; drawings of the two former we have, and will be given
in due course.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

in the year 1792, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy. It is a hardy greenhouse
plant; but has not, hitherto, been increased in this country. It must be
planted in very sandy peat earth, and not much watered, in winter, as
too much wet is apt to destroy it. The young branches, which in the old
plant appear much more like leaves, (as seldom any leaves are produced
from the upper part of the plant, after a certain age,) are very tender;
but in time become as tough as leather, and are almost equally pliable.
Our drawing was taken in May 1799, from a plant, we believe, the first

feet, or the extreme brilliancy of its blossoms, which frequently make a
spike near a foot in length. The roots should not be taken from the
pots, but shifted into fresh earth annually, which may be a composition
of half sandy peat, and half loam, as the leaves do not decay, until
fresh ones are produced. Our figure was taken at the Hammersmith
Nursery, in May 1800, to which it was first brought, from the Cape of
Good Hope, in 1792. It increases by the root.</p>

<p>In a cotemporary, and something similar publication to our own, we were
sorry to observe, a rising itch to do away, what, under the conduct of
its original scientific proprietor, was allowed by all, to constitute
its chief merit and utility; especially to those, “<i>who wish to become
scientifically acquainted with the plants they cultivate</i>.” The late Mr.
Curtis, pursuing the path he planned, with rigour, to prevent confusion,
and avoid as much as possible the greatest difficulty of the science;
seldom altered a commonly known, or established name; unless absolutely
necessary to systematic arrangement. We were naturally led to these
obvious observations, from the hints thrown out in the last Number of
the Bot. Mag. in which, the A. tubulosa of all the collections, which
possess the plant, and so named and figured by us, in the preceding
Number of the Botanists Repository, has a new generic and specific
title; and in which a gentleman “<i>with INFINITE skill</i>” of the name of
Gawler, the acknowledged father of the innovation, is spoken of as
qualified to scrutinize and rectify the “<i>errors, false synonims, and
blunders upon blunders, which have from carelessness</i>, &amp;c.” crept into
the, of course, insignificant labours of a Linnæus, a Jacquin, a
Thunberg, a Willdenow, or a Curtis. It may perhaps be an acquisition to
the science, that, since such confusion prevails amongst “<i>the most
learned Botanists</i>,” from their “<i>acknowledged inability to determine
those plants</i>;” which, nevertheless, they have all foolishly attempted
to do, we have one at last, whose “<i>scrutinizing</i>” eye “<i>has been able
to make out all Linnæus’s and even Thunberg’s species</i>.” This
elucidation, of so intricate a subject, by a person whose knowledge of
living plants, we fear, does not lead him, scarcely, to an
acquaintanceship with the difference of face in a Plane from a Poplar,
must be matter of infinite moment, to those, “<i>who wish to become
acquainted with the plants they cultivate</i>;” and the small trouble, to
most persons, of learning new, and ousting the old names for plants,
which have been long rivetted to the memory by habitual use, will be
amply compensated, by the pleasure of novelty, which must necessarily
result, from the certain alteration in some part of the title, of every
plant which has hitherto, or is to come under, this learned judge’s
dictatorial fiat. Our opinions, as do our labours, run counter to these
new fashions, of rendering a difficult science easy; and our road must
still be in the old track of the trifler Linnæus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

Gardens and Herbarium, (now, we presume, the first in Europe) with the
vegetable productions of that country. It has no apparent difference, in
habit, to require any other treatment than has been mentioned in the

introduced through the same medium. It is herbaceous, and generally
flowers, if kept in the hot-house, about August; having that true and
constant character of the genus, and from which it had its name, the
producing but one solitary, perfect flower, per diem, till all the
blossoms on the spike are exhausted; which, in this species, are much
more abundant than in any of the others. It is increased by the root or
seed.</p>

<p>This plant, we presume, is the same as those specified under the
different titles of Lilium Longiflorum, and L. Japonicum, in Willdenow’s
new edition of the Species Plant.; the L. candidum, and L. Japonicum, of
Thunberg’s Japan; and the L. Longiflorum of the Linn. Trans. Vol. II. P.
333. The Hemerocallis formerly figured by us, under the specific title
of Cærulea, we take to be, the Hemerocallis Japonica, and Lilium
Cordifolium of Willdenow; the H. Cordata of Thunberg’s Japan; and the
Hemerocallis Japonica, and Lilium Cordifolium of the Linn. Trans. Vol.
II. p. 332. Willdenow, who had never seen even dried specimens of the
plants in question, has hence been led to place the same plant, under
different genera; and to consider the Hemerocallis of the Botanists
Repository, as only a variety of H. Japonica, but still admitting it as
an Hemerocallis. Now, as we have no doubt, (nor do we think any one can,
that will take the trouble to examine the dissections given with each
figure,) that if the one is an Hemerocallis, the other must be admitted
of the same family; so, have we made no scruple in rejecting the generic
name of Lilium, for the present plant; although we would gladly have
adopted the specific one of Longiflora, had not that of Alba, already
obtained so generally in our gardens; a rule, for our direction,
paramount to all others as to specific denomination.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

collection our drawing was made, in June, this year, 1801. It appears to
be a hardy green-house plant; but, is certainly more curious than
handsome, and, from its general character, we should judge the
propagation would be from the root.</p>

<p>Professor Jacquin has given the Hypoxis Obliqua in his Icones Plantarum
Rariorum, 2. t. 371; and in his Supplement to the Collectanea, 54; but,
we must suppose from a more vigorous specimen than ours; as, the
appearance of a woolly character, at the margin of the leaves, was not
to be traced in our plant, although every other part is exact.
Wherefore, we have retained his name, though we have rejected the latter
part of his specific character, to introduce one, which we consider, of
more consequence, as opposed to those with bulbous roots, this being
fibrous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

be kept in the green-house, or hot-house, in a large tub filled with
water and a small portion of mud at the bottom. It propagates by the
root, and the flowers, which are extremely fragrant, are produced in
August, in which month, this year, our drawing was made, from a large
plant in the Hibbertian collection; but, from an omission in the figure,
we were obliged to finish the plate from a plant, in the collection of
J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, still in flower, the beginning of
October. The leaves of this species are most beautifully scolloped, and
near a foot in diameter; but the indentitions are scarcely to be
perceived in the younger; one of which, as we could not introduce the
larger, is shewn on the plate of the natural size.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, and was introduced to the Royal

raised at the seat of the Hon. the Marchioness of Rockingham,
Hillingdon, Middlesex, in the year 1793; and, from a plant, in the
conservatory, still in flower, this present month November, our drawing
was made, at the Nursery, Hammersmith. It is hardy, although delicate in
structure, and flourishes in the green-house. The stem of the plant from
which our figure was taken, although the oldest in the kingdom, and near
six feet high, is scarce the thickness of a quill at the base, therefore
must be supported. The young shoots and leaves are covered with a slight
pile; the smaller branches stand out at right angles, proceeding from
the insertion of the leaves, and the whole plant has, at first sight,
much the appearance of a Rubus. It is propagated by cuttings, made in
the month of March, and put under a small bell-glass on the heat of a
hot-bed; the cuttings should be from the extreme ends of the young
shoots. Sir J. Banks, Bart. P. R. S. &amp;c. from whose natural genius and
love for the science, and by whose fostering and liberal hand to promote
it, the study of Botany has become so general a taste; has named this
genus, in honour of two most eminent Botanical painters, of the name of
Bauer, natives of Germany, and brothers. The one, now under the
immediate patronage of Sir Joseph, as Botanical Painter to his Majesty
at Kew; well known for his superb and excellent coloured engravings of
Heaths, &amp;c. in large folio. The younger considered no less able, engaged
under the same influence, with the other artists, &amp;c. who are now upon
the last expedition for discovery to the South Sea; but not equally
known to Botanists, as the person who accompanied the late Dr.
Sibthorpe, on his voyages through Greece; and whose pencil has produced
all those drawings, designed to decorate and illustrate the famous Flora
Græca, preparing for the public, under the auspices of the intelligent
Dr. Smith, P. L. S. &amp;c. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p>Again have we to call upon the indulgence of our Botanical friends for
their sufferance, in a third intrusion on the forms of our own
prescription. But, as we had given the two other varieties of this fine
plant; and taking it for granted, by judging from our own feelings, that
a figure of this very scarce variety would be agreeable to most; that
they might be (by comparison) able to decide upon the difference which
does exist, but has been denied by many, between this, and the Striped
Var.; see our figure, Vol. II. Pl. XCI. It has been thought by most, who
have not seen this plant; that it was but the Striped Var. which had
lost its variegation. This is certainly not the case; for, it stands as
distinct from the Striped, as from the White variety; which may be
readily traced, either from the plants themselves, or our figures; by
comparing the specific, or rather differing character we have assigned
to each. The Double red Camellia was introduced about the year 1794 from
China, by R. Preston, Esq. Woodford, Essex.</p>

<p>The largest plant now in Europe, of this variety, is in the select and
most valuable collection of the Hon. T. Greville, Esq. Paddington,
imported, last year, from China in the highest perfection. It is
propagated by cuttings, or layers; and delights in a light, sandy loam;
with about one-third of the pot, from the bottom, filled with peat
earth. It flowers from November, till February, in the Hothouse; or from
January, till April, if kept in the Green-house. Our figure was taken,
in November, this year, at the Hammersmith Nursery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1792 this plant was first raised from seeds, by the late
Mr. William Malcolm, Nurseryman, at Stockwell, Surry; and was, from the
very great resemblance it bears to the St. John’s-worts, so denominated,
until it flowered. It has now become one of the commonest, of what are
generally termed, Botany Bay plants; yet unquestionably ranks with the
handsomest whether for its foliage, form of growth, or flowers, which
are of a most beautiful red-purple, scarcely to be imitated in painting.
The singular manner in which the flower-stem is thrown out, as it were,
from the old wood, in a horizontal direction, is common to many other
species of the Genus. It grows to the height of four or five feet, very
erect in every part; is easily increased by cuttings, and thrives best
in peat earth. Although it is said to grow in swampy grounds in New
South Wales, see Linnæan Transactions, Vol. III. p. 279, nevertheless,
with us, a dry, or damp situation in the green-house, appears equally
congenial to it. In the month of September 1799, our drawing was taken
at the Conservatory of R. James, Esq. Grosvenor Place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> plant is herbaceous, and is found near the sea coast, in most parts
of the world, within the tropics. It has a character common to many
Genera of the natural order of succulents, such as Mesembryanthemum,
Crassula, &amp;c. that of an indeterminate number of pointals; which, in
this genus, extend from three, to five, on different plants; this
circumstance not having been sufficiently attended to has unfortunately
occasioned some confusion. Brown in his Natural History of Jamaica has
described it as growing on that Island, and with five pointals,
therefore placed it to its right genus. Plumier, Sloane, &amp;c. treated it
as Portulaca, to which, as the genus now stands, it in no way affines.
Læfling in his Iter Hispanicum, published in 1758, having found the
plant in Spain with three pointals, immediately placed it to another
genus, Halimum; upon whose authority, corroborated by Jacquin, (who
acknowledges a variation in the number of pointals, on different plants,
found in the different Caribee Islands,) Linnæus took up the plant, said
to have but three pointals, under the title Sesuvium. As to the plant
said to be cultivated by Miller in the Hort. Kew: under the last named
genus, we have no difficulty in referring that, to the Aizoon canariense
of the same work; as the time of flowering not being noticed, the
distinction of character could not be observed, and the genus
introduced, taken upon the <i>gratis dictum</i> of Miller. Burmann, in his
Ed: of Rumphius’s plants of Amboyna, has it as Halimus; and Plukenet as
Portulaca from East Indian specimens; with numbers of other Botanists
from different parts; as Ægypt, the Canary Islands, &amp;c. &amp;c. under
different names.</p>

<p>Seeds received from Spain of our plant were sown by Mr. Anderson in
1798, at the gardens of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore; since which time,
it has annually died to the ground, about November, and re-appeared in
Spring; from this circumstance, the great delicacy of the plant, and
having been treated as an annual, it has been repeatedly lost to this
country; though so constantly introduced, in almost every parcel of
seeds which arrives from either the East or West Indies. It may be
increased by cuttings made early in the year, and put in a hot-bed to
accelerate their growth, and should be planted in rich loamy earth. It
flowers from July till September. To preserve it more than one year, it
must be kept in the hot-house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

of the Botanic garden, originally established there, under the sanction

about three feet in height, making but few small branches, and rather
weak in the stem. Our drawing was taken in July this year at the garden
of T. Evans, Esq. Stepney, who we believe first had it to flower in this

<p>Here we have a plant which presents one of those obstacles, constantly
met, in all attempts to a systematic arrangement of the productions of
nature. Every feature of Ixia we find positively expressed, but in the
unison of the Threads; a circumstance, which Linnæus in his system,
always deemed of such singular moment, that a number of Genera have been
formed, from this natural order of plants, hinging on this only
character.</p>

<p>But, as this plant has been named, and accurately described by Mr.
Salisbury, in the Prodromus to his garden 36. n. 18; and continued, from
him, by Professor Martyn, in his Edit. of Miller’s Dict. article Ixia,
50; in the following therefore such superiour judgments to our own, we
have thought it proper, not to make any alteration; and in consequence,
have retained his Generic and Specific title. The extreme brilliance of
the flowers of Ixia Columnaris, pervading all the varieties, (of which
we have drawings of 6,) is not exceeded by any in the whole Genus; they
generally, are not longer expanded than for about four hours, and that
only under a hot sun; from about eight, till twelve o’clock; when they
close for the day; but nevertheless they have a permanence not usual in
Ixias, as the same blossoms will open diurnally for above a week. It is
a native of the Cape of Good Hope, and came first to England, by the way
of Holland, about the year 1794. It flowers in June and July, amongst
the latest of the tribe, and increases by the root in abundance. Our
figure was taken at the Hammersmith Nursery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>No Class, amongst the 24, is more distinct in its natural character than
Diadelphia; yet, since the discovery of New South Wales, no one has
presented more difficulty to the botanist. From the great number of
plants of that country, appertaining to this Class, and the strong
differing characters which most of them exhibit, such indeed, as might
formerly have been thought of sufficient moment to constitute new
Genera; many must now bend a little for the ease of science; or
otherwise they will in a short time become doubled in number; a matter
of no small moment to weak although willing memories. Our having placed
the P. scolopendrum of this Volume, Pl. CXCI., and our present plant to
the Genus Platylobium, is the occasion of the above prelude; as it may
be thought by some who have not seen the seed vessel and seeds, the
principal parts upon which the Genus is founded, that nature is a little
outraged in so doing; but, without we had so joined them, we must have
given them a new title. This plant was introduced at the same time as
the P. scolopendrum, and the three other species now in Britain; not one
of them, but has baffled all our most experienced cultivators to
increase it, by any other mode than from the seed; some of which has
been procured from the P. formosum, only. They all require to be kept in
the dryest part of the green-house, as they are impatient of damp. Our
drawing was made in November 1801, at the Nursery of Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy, Hammersmith, by whom it was first raised in 1792. The general
height of the Platylobiums, is about three feet and a half, at most, in
this country, and they do not form bushy shrubs. They require a light,
sandy peat soil, with rather less root room, than is in general
necessary for plants of equal size.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1776, this plant was first received in England, by
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy from Montreal, Canada, N. America. It is a
native of all the northern parts of that country, as far as New England;
propagates itself by the root, and flowers in July. It will not thrive
but on a shady border, which should be made of light sandy peat.</p>

<p>Much we revere the name of Solander, and highly rate his merit as a
Botanist; yet we cannot forbear stating our dissent from the arrangement
of this plant, as a Dracæna, certainly nothing can be more dissimilar,
in every part; this may be easily traced by comparing our figure and
dissections, as connected with the Generic character. The whole natural
habit of the plant, points out Convallaria for its genus, to which it is
much nearer allied than Dracæna, even in the sexual characters. However,
we only state our opinions, without even thinking of change, as the
plant is known as Dracæna, having been figured and described in the
First Vol. of the Kew Catalogue, page 454, under the present title.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1792 J. Ord, Esq. of Pursers Cross, Fulham, received the
seeds of this Mimosa from New South Wales; the plants were raised, the
ensuing year, by Mr. White, who has managed, much to his credit, the
select collection of that Gentleman near 20 years, and who obligingly
sent us a fine specimen in March 1801, taken from a plant near 18 feet
in height. Of the Mimosas now in Britain, we think, this species is
likely to exceed them all in height; making a very handsome plant; and
most beautiful at the season when covered with its long pendulous
bunches of flowers. It is increased by cuttings, but with difficulty;
and, as yet, seeds have not been perfected in this country. A light
sandy earth is what it thrives in most, but it will grow in almost any
soil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> singularity of this plant recommends it to our notice, rather than
its beauty. It is a native of New South Wales, near Port Jackson, and is
found in marshy grounds; where its branches are seen to extend many
yards, embracing all the under shrubs they meet; they seldom exceed the
size of small twine, but are exceeding tough. The whole plant, when old,
has a dirty or rusty brown appearance, the leaves becoming very small
and narrow; although from culture in this country, we have seen the
leaves, on some plants, near an inch in breadth, and three in length.
For the Generic and Specific titles of this plant we are indebted to Dr.
Smith, P. L. S. &amp;c. and we do not think more appropriate ones could have
been invented. The giving specific names and characters to plants, where
only one has been discovered of the Genus, although a little from
Linnæan principles, we must confess accords with our ideas; for,
although, to compare is necessary to distinctive difference; yet, if the
most ostensible, and novel appearance of the parts, are taken from the
first discovered plant, for the specific character; there is no more
danger of confusion, from any addition to the Genus, than if no such
observations had been made; for, what must in future be taken as
specific distinction must arise from an opposition to the first plant on
which the Genus was founded: wherefore we have adopted this manner, from
the commencement of the work. This plant was first raised at the
Hammersmith Nursery, from seeds received from New South Wales in 1791.
It is propagated by cuttings taken from the young shoots, in April;
should be planted in very sandy peat earth, and kept very dry in winter.
It is in flower nearly the whole year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> species of Geranium has been given by Professor Jacquin in his
Icon: rar. 514, and his Collectanea 4. 188; from him, we find it
collated by Professor Martyn into his Edit. of Miller’s Dict. under the
article Pelargonium, 59. But, as no notice has been taken by Jacquin of
so remarkable a circumstance as this species being Dioecious, or with
male and female flowers on different plants; we may be led to suppose,
that it has not flowered in Germany; or that the specimens he had seen,
were from male plants, as he numbers the fertile chives as five, which
could not have been discovered from a female specimen. Of five plants we
had the good fortune to examine, which were all in flower at the same
time, the roots of which had been imported from the Cape of Good Hope in
the year 1793; three were male, with five fertile tips, the pointals
obsolete; and two female, without the least trace of a tip, in either
blossom, or bud. As the tips frequently fall upon the expansion of the
flower, in many species, the bud is the only sure situs whence to
determine this character. It is increased from seed, procured from
female plants only, which are much more unfrequent than the male;
likewise from the roots, which, (like to those of most of the species
forming this link of the Genus,) are tuberous; forming small bulbs of
unequal sizes, connected to the main root by slight radicles, and at a
little distance from it: which, indeed, is the reason we have not
adopted the term rapaceous, or turnip rooted, although it is a character
which has been applied to them by very able Botanists, yet we think
unadvisedly, or from their not having had the opportunity of examining
them closely; as, we presume, this term cannot with propriety be given
to any root which is composed of more than one body, as are the Turnip,
Carrot, Parsnip, Radish, &amp;c. where it applies. It must be planted in
light peat earth, and kept in the dryest part of the green-house, where
it will flower about the month of July. Our figure was taken at Clapham
in June, this year, from a male plant in the Hibbertian Collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> very handsome Antholyza, which is seen so seldom to flower, in this
kingdom, has been long an inhabitant of our gardens. So long ago as
1759, it is said to have been cultivated by Miller; and from the firm
and hardy character of the root, we should question its having been
since that period, ever, like many others of this natural order, left to
us. The unfrequency of its flowering has, perhaps, occasioned the
inattention, which is in general shewn to its cultivation, though most
collectors possess the bulbs, few have seen their flowers. Our figure
was taken in the month of July, this year, from a plant in the
collection of T. Evans, Esq. Stepney. It is increased from the roots,
which should be removed from the pots in July, and replanted the end of
October. We have not been able to procure any certain data on which to
give directions to insure its flowering; but the plant in question was
planted in a very large pot, the earth was a compound of light peat one
part, stiff loam one part, and old rotten dung one part. It has been
thought by some, that the Antholyza we have figured in the Botanist’s
Repository, Plate XXXI. was the A. Æthiopica of Linnæus, &amp;c; but, we
have given it as a broad-leaved variety of the A. ringens of that
author, as we have a drawing of the Narrow leaved Var: taken from a
living plant, to which, as well as to our present figure, it much
affines; and, we are led to think, natural order would not be much
violated, if we had treated them all as varieties of one species.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

transmitted to England, by Col. Paterson, in the year 1793. It is a
climbing plant, the branches acquiring a considerable length, the bark
being covered with small tubercles, like glands, and the younger
branches covered, their whole length, with blossoms. Although this is
not to be reckoned amongst the handsomest of the productions of that
country, yet, from the lively colour of the flowers, the profusion of
them which the plant produces, and their continued succession, from
April, till September, it must be considered as a valuable addition to
the small number of scandent plants, as yet in our green-houses; more
particularly at the present juncture, when, from fashion, a trellis has
become a necessary appendage to them. It is propagated from the seeds,
which ripen in this country; as well as from cuttings, which should be
made in May, and kept in the heat of a cucumber-frame, or hot-house,
till they are rooted. It is grown best in sandy peat. Our figure was
taken at the Hammersmith Nursery, where it was first raised in this
kingdom. The name, Pogonia, is derived from the appearance of the mouth
of the flower which is bearded; Πωγωνιον, <i>Pogonion</i>, signifying a
little beard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

this variety are remarkably thick at the insertion into the tube, and
have a soft, beautiful brown on the outside, when the flower is closed,
which still is never so fully so, but a small margin of the blue
appears; which gives them a most beautiful appearance in that state. No

without much forcing of the characters of the genus, have been so
continued; but our opinions shall always give way, when the decision is
past from such superior talents as those of Dr. Smith; by whom it has
been thought to possess a sufficiency of distinctive character, on which
to form a new genus, under the title it here bears. It is a bushy shrub,
grows to the height of three feet, the branches standing out almost
horizontally, in whorls, and the whole plant bearing a great resemblance
to the Rosemary. It is propagated by cuttings made in March from the end
of the small branches; approves most of light sandy peat, and is in
flower from March till November. The whole plant is scentless.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

Holland. The Willow-like Embothrium makes a very handsome bushy
green-house plant; the leaves are not subject to damp, and the stem
acquires the height of 5 or 6 feet. It flowers about May, and from the
manner in which the leaves rather fall downwards, from their insertion,
leaving the bunches of flowers fully exposed, at their base, it has a
very picturesque appearance, as the whole plant is sometimes covered
with blossoms. It thrives best in sandy peat earth, and is increased by
cuttings, made about March, or April, and placed in the heat of the
Hot-house, or a cucumber frame. Our figure was taken at the Hammersmith
Nursery; where, it was first raised from seeds, in the year 1791.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

bids fair to become one of the greatest ornaments of our hot-houses; 20
species we already enumerate, in the different collections in the
vicinity of London; one of which, the present plant, has not flowered in
this kingdom, till this year, although introduced, so long ago as 1793,
by the late J. Slater, Esq. of Layton-stone; at the same time with the
two varieties of the Double Camellia, from China. Our figure was taken
in September 1801, from a plant which had been placed in the spring of
the same year, in the Conservatory built on purpose for the protection
of Chinese plants, and where they flourish to a degree, not seen before
in this country, in the garden of G. Hibbert Esq. Clapham common. It is
propagated by offsets, from the root; is rather a hardy hot-house plant;
and thrives most in a mixture of sandy loam, and peat; about one fourth
of the loam, and three fourths peat, or leaf-mould.</p>

<p>Upon the first observation of this plant, we were inclined to think it
the species designed by Thunberg in his Icon. Plant. Japon. 28, under
the Genus Limodorum; and afterwards, altered by him, in the Linnæan
Trans. Vol. ii. p. 327, to Epidendrum striatum. But upon close
examination of it, as answering his descriptions, &amp;c. we cannot but
think it, if not a different species, at least a very strong variety of
his plant; wherefore, we have retained the name it is in common known
by, in the various collections in which we have seen it. If we were to
decide on the subject, it should be to place both that and this plant
again to Limodorum; to which, they hold greater affinity than to
Epidendrum; but indeed, we have an opinion, that one title might readily
serve for the plants constituting both genera.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

the year 1731, and to have been then cultivated by Miller. It is
likewise said to be a native of Dominica, but it is found in all the
West India islands. It rarely flowers in this climate; and we should not
now have been able to gratify our friends with this figure, but for the
particular ingenuity, in the treatment of hot house plants, by Mr.
Anderson, superintendant of the rich collection of plants in the gardens
of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore, who by a long experience in
cultivation, added to a particular love for the profession, has placed
his knowledge in the treatment of exotics, in particular, much beyond
most cultivators of the present day. Our figure was taken from a plant
which continued in flower from July till November; it was planted in a
border of rich earth, close to the tan-pit, and trailed along the front
rafter of the house; the only method, we presume, by which it can be
induced to flower, as we have never seen it elsewhere. It is propagated
with ease by cuttings.</p>

<p>Much contention has arisen among Botanists, since the days of Linnæus,
where to place this tribe of plants. Swartz placed it to Monadelphia,
who is lately followed by Willdenow. Schreber, Thunberg, &amp;c. have thrown
it to Pentandria. But our antiquated notions of the capability of that
great man, in classifying to his own system, those plants which came
under his actual review, has occasioned our retaining it, under its old
class, just as he left it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

flowered, the plant was not known, although in the collection of Messrs.
Lee and Kennedy, three years precedent to that publication; and where,
it first flowered in 1795. Our figure was taken in September 1789 from a
plant (we fear the only one at present in this kingdom) in the
Hibbertian collection. It has not yet been propagated with us, and the
seeds do not mature. The plant is nearly four feet high, and forms a
handsome, bushy shrub, continuing in flower nearly the whole summer.

with a vigorous growth, is to place it in a considerable degree of
warmth, such as the heat of the hot-house, the pot being kept in a pan,
with water. With this assistance, it may be made to flower, sometimes,
about the end of May. It is a very hardy bulb, in what regards the root,

species of the genus, a native of the Cape of Good Hope, and was
introduced to Britain, in the year 1796, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy; at
whose nursery, our figure was taken in the year 1800; where, it had then
flowered for the first time, in this kingdom. It is a hardy greenhouse
bulb; propagates from the root, and perfects its seeds; flowers in
February and March, and loses its leaves in June. It stands quite
distinct from M. latifolia, both in the character of the leaves and
blossoms; though, at first sight, it has much the appearance of that
species. A loamy soil lightened by a small mixture of sandy peat is that
it most approves. The roots should not be taken from the pots after the
decay of the leaves, but kept rather dry till the leaves begin to
re-appear.</p>

<p>Much will it contribute to the illustration of science, to find our
present figure, when copied into a certain magazine at some future
period, (and of which we have no doubt,) specifically denominated,
smooth-leaved; as unfortunately, the other species figured by us, Pl.
46. Vol. I. with obovate, blunt-ended, or spathula-shaped leaves, has
been, by a certain hocus-pocus conjuror, and <i>our very good friend</i>,

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> genus was first formed by Thunberg as distinct from Melanthium, in
his <i>Dissertatio Nova Genera Plantarum</i>, under the title Wurmbea, from
the construction of the blossom, which in this, is formed of one petal,
but in that, is composed of six; a distinction which has always been
considered as momentous, in determining the limits of the different
genera of this class; since which, however, it has been abandoned by
him, and thrown to Melanthium; although Schreber, in his Genera
Plantarum, G. 617. p. 239. Vol. I. made no scruple in adopting it.
Willdenow has, in his Species Plantarum, G. 703. p. 265. T. 11. P. 1. we
think with propriety, renewed its claims to particular distinction,
under the first title; but with this difference, that out of the four
varieties given by Thunberg, all under the specific name of capensis, he
has made three species; reserving his opinion on the fourth, our present
plant, and the second Var. of Thunberg, for want, as he observes, of
proper documents. Now, as our ideas run not exactly with Willdenow, in
this alteration; but thinking with Thunberg, who must have seen the
plants alive, and thence, of course, the best judge; we have the rather
followed him; as we possess drawings of two more of the varieties quoted
by him, taken from living specimens, and whose trifling difference of
character does not warrant them to be treated as specifically different,
but as mere varieties of each other.</p>

<p>The roots of this species, with the others, of which we have drawings,
were received by G. Hibbert, Esq. in the year 1800, from the Cape of
Good Hope. The bulbs are solid like those of Ixia, &amp;c. but of a most
singular form, having an appendage at the base like the pat of a mole.
None of the varieties we have seen produce more than three leaves, which
sheath the flower-stem one above the other, and are rather longer than
it. It flourishes in sandy peat earth, and flowers in May or June; but
has, certainly, more to recommend it to our notice from its singularity,
as forming a separate genus; than from its beauty. Our figure was taken
from the Clapham collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

from the Cape, in 1801. To affix any particular period as the exact
season of its flowering, would be premature; as, the plant from which
our figure was taken, in the month of August, last year, had been kept
constantly in the green-house; and, we must presume, as the root arrived
nearly dry, the regular season of its flowering must have been
materially altered. It appears to flourish in a light sandy soil. The
propagation must be from the seeds, or from the root.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

described by Plumier, Sloan, Jacquin, Browne, &amp;c.; but no good figure of
the plant, according with our ideas, has hitherto been given of it. The
C. rosea, C. alba, and C. flava of Jacquin, the three various species,
are said to grow to different heights, in the different Islands; which
we are led to think, are but varieties of the same plant. Linnæus has
taken them up as species, upon his authority; although Jacquin himself
allows, that the one he denominates <i>flava</i>, varies in its blossoms to
red and white. This plant does not grow to above the height of eight or
nine feet, in this country, and seldom flowers. Our figure was taken
last year in September 1801, from a plant in the Stepney Collection.
Miller says it was cultivated by him in 1759, and had been introduced by
Mr. Parker, of Croydon, in Surrey, from Barbadoes. It is readily
propagated from cuttings, and thrives in rich, dungy earth. A slight
mistake occurs, in the quotation from Browne, in Martyn’s Edition of the
Dictionary; where, the petals are described as screw-shaped; Browne has
it, “<i>cochleata</i>,” or shell-shaped, a most expressive term for the shape
of these petals.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

excess of wet, in the winter, is sure to destroy it; even in summer,
much rain, if it is exposed to it for a few days, will overwhelm it. The
Kew Catalogue mentions this species to have been introduced in the year
1788, by Mr. F. Masson. The plant grows to the height of three feet,
with a very slender stem, and, often, loses most of its leaves to a
considerable height from the earth, which gives it rather a disagreeable
appearance towards the lower part. A mixture of two-thirds loam, and one
of sandy peat, is a soil it most approves. It is increased by cuttings,
made in the month of April, from the tender shoots. Our figure was taken
in July, from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

appearance of the plant, it is by nature deciduous, and, certainly hardy
enough to be preserved in the greenhouse, if not to bear the exposure of
the open ground. It grows to the height of about two feet, flowers in
the hot-house about September or later, and is propagated by cuttings.
The blossoms are very fragrant, but of short duration. To the late J.
Slater, Esq. of Laytonstone, we owe this plant; which was one of that
rich cargo brought home in the Carnatic, for him, by Captain Connor, in
the year 1793. Our figure was taken at the Hammersmith nursery. The
accession to this magnificent Genus has been considerable within a very
few years: to the species formerly cultivated in Britain, viz. the
<i>grandiflora</i> with its four varieties, the <i>glauca</i> and its two
varieties, the <i>acuminata</i> and <i>tripetala</i>, are now added; the
<i>auriculata</i> and <i>maxima</i>, from America; the <i>pumila</i>, <i>fuscata</i> and
<i>tomentosa</i> or <i>Yow-lang</i>, from China; making in all, with the
varieties, fifteen. The short acquaintance we have with the three last
from China, or the knowledge of what part of that extensive country they
are natives, does not enable us to decide, whether they will endure our
winters; although we may on the two from America, as being hardy plants,
or at least equally hardy with the <i>grandiflora</i>, being from the same
part of America.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

Vol. I. of this work; the only specimen we have ever seen of it, is in

1801, in the month of May. It is a strong variety, but we cannot
consider the difference it exhibits, from our first figure, of
sufficient prominence to warrant a specific distinction. The bulbs were
received at Clapham, in the autumn of 1800, from the Cape of Good Hope;
they are rather delicate, and the treatment must be such as directed for
the former variety of this species.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Barnard Dickinson, Esq. of Monks-House, near Devises, Wilts, we believe
to be, at present, the only possessor, in Britain, of this fine variety
of Hibiscus mutabilis. The plants were produced in 1788, from some
Jamaica seeds, which were sown at Bowden, another adjoining seat of that
gentleman, and where they have flowered for several years. Although the
flowers are double; yet good seeds are produced, which is common to most
plants of this natural order, such as Alcea Malva, &amp;c. the fullness of
the blossoms being, as usual, formed from some of the chives becoming
petals, many nevertheless remaining perfect; which in these plants stand
particularly distinct from the pointal, being seated on the upper part
of the tube, formed by the connection of the lower part of the threads,
leaving the pointal as perfect as in a single flower. It is also
propagated by cutting, and thrives in rich earth. It may be considered
rather a tree, than shrub, as even in this country, it acquires the
height of from 15 to 20 feet. It is a native of Japan, China, and the
East Indies; where it is much esteemed for the extreme beauty of its
flowers, as well as in our West India islands, where it is also
cultivated. The Single-flowered has been known in England above a
century, having, says the Kew Catalogue, been introduced by Mr. Bentinck
in the year 1690. The specific title is assumed on the singular change
of the flower, from white to flesh colour, before its decay, as shewn in
our figure; which was taken from a fine branch received in a perfect
state from Bowden in the month of November 1801, and obligingly
communicated, to the author, by Mrs. Dickinson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the Magnolias with which we are as yet acquainted, this species
is the most elegant; whether for the growth of the plant, the brilliancy
of the foliage, or the extreme delicacy, fragrance, and beauty of the
flowers. It is a native of China; from whence it was first introduced to
us, in the year 1796, by T. Evans, Esq. of Stepney; from a plant in
whose collection, our figure was taken, this year, 1802, in the month of
February, the general season of its flowering in this climate if kept in
the hot-house; to which station it has, as yet, been doomed, although,
from the general character of the Genus, we should be led to treat it
more hardily. It is increased by cuttings, and layers; but the first is
the best method, as, in the latter mode the branches do not take root
under two years. The plant from which our drawing was made, did not
exceed a foot and a half in height, which leads us to suppose it never
becomes a large shrub, even in China. It thrives in leaf mould, and
light loam. We believe this plant has not hitherto come under the review
of any botanical author.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

distinct; but, that the same species was hermaphrodite, when growing in
New Zealand, which may perhaps be the fact, though we should suspect,
from such circumstance, they were different species. Martyn in his Ed.
of Miller’s Dict. mentions this plant, and throws it to the broad-leaved
species found in the tropical climates of America and Asia. Willdenow,
in his Sp. Plant. Tom. 11. P. 1. p. 345, has made it a species, without
any observation on its parts of fructification; which leads us to
suppose, he had not seen flowering specimens. It is as hardy as any
greenhouse plant we possess, but will not resist the severity of our
frosts; is easily propagated by cuttings, and thrives in almost any
earth. It is so very common in New Holland, that, scarce a parcel of
seeds has arrived from thence, but has contained some of the seeds. The
two figures were taken from two plants at the nursery Hammersmith.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

delights most in a rich soil, and flowers in July, or August. It is said
to acquire the height of ten feet, in its native clime, but, with us, it
seldom attains to three; becoming a handsome, bushy shrub. The flowers
have a faint smell, as have most of this natural order; the whole plant
is replete with a whitish juice, of a most deleterious quality; and the
wood when rubbed emits a disagreeable odour. The fruit is considered by
the indians as a deadly poison against which there is no antidote. Our
figure was taken from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection, Clapham.
Introduced to England, (or rather cultivated about that period) says the

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Green-flowered Melanthium was introduced to the Kew collection, by
Mr. F. Masson, in the year 1788, as we are informed by the catalogue of
that garden, from the Cape of Good Hope. The plant from which our figure
was taken, had been sent to the Clapham collection amongst other bulbs
which were received from Mr. Niven in the year 1800; it flowered the
succeeding year, when our drawing was made. We believe, at present, it
is in no other collection than that of Mr. Hibbert; nor do we think,
without a fresh supply, it will be long seen in this country, as it has
been often introduced, and as often lost; nor does it increase with us
by the root, and the seeds have not, as yet, matured in this country; it
appears to grow luxuriantly in sandy peat earth, and flowers in July.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>From a plant now in flower, May 1802, in the Hibbertian collection, our
figure was taken. It is one of those described by Thunberg in his
Dissertatio de Protea, n. 11, and in his Prodromus 25, under the title
we have given it; and which is, certainly, very appropriate; although
many have the flowers growing in spikes. We believe this is the first
time it has flowered in Britain, and that, at present, it is very
scarce; having been introduced by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy in the year
1790. It is a hardy greenhouse plant, is increased by cuttings, and
thrives in a sandy loam with a small portion of sandy peat earth. Native
of the Cape of Good Hope.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1788 the seeds of this plant were received, from New South
Wales, by a number of persons; and were raised, the same year, by most
of those who sowed the seeds. The character of the plant from whence it
derives its specific title is much lost in its advanced state; but in
the first two or three years of its growth, it is extremely powerful;
the under part of the young leaves being of a bright purple. It is
extremely difficult to propagate from cuttings; and it has not, as yet,
perfected its seeds in England. It grows to the height of six or seven
feet; is a hardy green-house plant; and thrives most in sandy peat
earth. Our figure was made from a very fine specimen, communicated by
the Hon. W. H. Irby, in September 1801, from his elegant collection at
the Parsonage, Farnham Royal, near Windsor, Bucks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

roots of this plant are rather more tender, or delicate, than those of
the yellow variety; which makes it scarcer, and much less known. The
nursery, Hammersmith, is the only place at which we have seen it; and,
we believe, they have it not in Holland. The root from which our figure
was taken, had been imported, from the Cape, in 1801. It flowers in
April, and increases by the root; should be planted in very light sandy
peat earth, and removed from the pot soon after the flowers are
decayed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>As an annual, this is a most beautiful little plant; but, although the
seeds have been received several times, from the Cape of Good Hope,
where it is native; and first at the Royal Gardens, Kew, in 1787, sent
by Mr. F. Masson; yet, has it never been seen the second year; owing, we
suppose, to the impracticability of procuring ripe seeds in our climate.
Perhaps future trials, by different treatment, may meet with a happier
issue. The figure was taken at the Clapham Garden, in August 1800; when
the plant had apparently attained its greatest perfection; but
unfortunately, no seeds ripened; and at present, we believe, there is no
vestige of the plant in Britain. It appears to delight in sandy peat,
and to be kept under cover, even in the summer season.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

and stemless, not including the G. triste, G. lobatum, or G. prolificum;
and of which, although we have given many figures, we still possess
drawings of 18 handsome species, besides numberless varieties. It was
introduced in 1788 by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy; is a hardy greenhouse
plant, being less subject to rot, after the decay of the leaves, than
any of its congeners; flowers freely about June, and is propagated by
the root; the seed (sometimes) ripens likewise. Our figure was taken
from a plant, whose root had been received at the Clapham Garden, in
1800. As all the plants figured in the Botanist’s Repository, are titled
with the commonly accepted names, if any, in England; and, as many have
been given under different names, in some other publications, whence
much confusion; we shall defer all attempt at synonim, till the end of
this Volume, when a copious <i>Index Synonimorum</i> will be published, of
all the plants figured in the work, for the use of those who wish for
such authorities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>As a singularity among its fellows, this Gladiolus stands prominently
distinct; and the uncommon and curious formation of its flowers will,
undoubtedly, counterbalance, in the eye of the botanist, what they want
in brilliancy of colour. It is a hardy bulb, and appears to require only
the usual treatment of the hardier species of the genus. The Clapham
collection is, we believe, the only one in which it is to be found in
England; to which it was introduced, by Mr. Niven, in the spring of the
year 1801, and where our drawing was made, this present year, in the
month of March 1802.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the number of very beautiful plants introduced by Mr. Niven, and
which now enrich that fund of botanical rarity, the Clapham collection,
this species of Xeranthemum does not stand the least conspicuous. Twelve
years since we possessed but four species of this genus, viz. X.
fulgidum, X. retortum, X. vestitum, and X. speciocissimum; now they
extend to fourteen. The others, as well as the foregoing, are all (but
one, the X. lucidum of Port Jackson, New South Wales) from the Cape of
Good Hope, and introduced to us from thence, by various hands, in the
following order; X. proliferum, through Holland, by Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy; X. formosum and X. candicans by the same, from Cape seeds; X.
sessamoides by Mrs. Gostling, of Hounslow; X. filiforme by Mr. Dunn, of
Cambridge; X. fasciculatum and X. truncatum by G. Hibbert, Esq. X.
argenteum and X. spirale by Montague Burgoyne, Esq. of Mark Hall, Essex.
They are very subject to damp in the leaves, from a confined air
therefore, should be kept in the window, or most airy part of the
greenhouse. The most sandy peat that can be procured is the best for
their growth. They may be all, thus, propagated by cuttings, taken off
in the early part of the month of June; put these into a pot filled with
sand, and covered by a bell-glass the size of the pot; plunge it in a
north or east border, and let the whole be covered with a hand glass,
which must be kept quite close till the cuttings are rooted; then the
inner glass must be removed, and in about a week the pot maybe taken
from under the outer one, when the plants may be removed into small pots
in about a fortnight. Our present plant seldom grows higher than two
feet, of which, at least, one is the foot-stalks of the flowers; it
continues in flower from March till September.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

winged-leaved kind of Proteas; of which division, in this large family,

This plant grows to the height of three feet, makes a very bushy head,
and, when in flower, has a handsome appearance; as there are sometimes
twenty spikes of flowers on it at one time. It is propagated by

<p>We have little doubt but that this is the species of Day-Lily known to
botanists, since the days of Parkinson and Gerarde, under the character
of a small leaved variety of the Yellow Day-Lily, although it has been
many years lost to the country. It is one amongst the many plants
introduced by the late Dr. Sibthorpe, to the Oxford botanic garden. As a
native of the northern parts of Europe, it is as hardy as either the H.
flava or H. fulva, to both which species it bears strong affinity;
although, we conceive, sufficiently distinct from either, to constitute
a species; which however we should not have done, but that the plant is
now known in our gardens, under our specific title. The flowers of this
plant last, in general, two or three days before they decay, are very
sweet scented, and as large as those of the H. fulva. It is increased as
easily as any of the genus, by parting the roots, and thrives in almost
any soil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

as we could not trace it as described in any author, we have given it
the trivial name it here bears. The figure exhibits a large specimen of
the whole plant, which is too weak to support itself, although the
leaves are thick and stiff. Our drawing was made in the month of April,
from a plant in the Clapham collection, where only it is to be found;
the roots having been sent from the Cape of Good Hope in the autumn of
the preceding year. It appears to flourish with the treatment Mr. Allen
has given it, a dry situation, planted in very sandy peat. From the
construction of the root, which has a hard smooth skin, we should be led
to think its increase will not be very abundant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>Our figure, which exhibits a small plant, of this superb species of
tuberous Geranium, was taken in the month of June, this year, 1802, at
Messrs. Colville’s nursery, King’s Road, Chelsea, and where it is still
in high perfection, this present month of July. We have every reason to
believe, from all the authorities we are masters of, that this plant has
not, till now, flowered in Europe. It forms a very large tuberous root,
by the dividing of which it is to be propagated; as we suspect the seeds
will not ripen on this species more than most of its congeners. It has
the same manner with the rest of the tuberous species, losing its leaves
in winter, when they are subject to rot, if much watered. Appears to
flourish in sandy peat, with a small portion of rotten dung.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

by cuttings, to be made in the month of April or May, and treated as
directed for the other Proteas. The plant seldom grows higher than three
feet, and does not make many branches; but is of a lively green colour,
both leaves and stem. We have, as usual, adopted the name this plant is
generally known by, it having been so named by the younger Linnæus in
his Suppl. Plant. 118, and by Thunberg in his Dissertatio de Protea, p.

gardens the plant has flowered, for the first time, in England this
year, in the month of April, and at which time our figure was taken. The
Pitcairnias are all natives of West India Islands, and stand, as the
link, between the Bromelia or Pine-apple plant, and the Tillandsia; to
either of which Genera the first sight of the leaves, only, would
consign them. Five species are now in Britain, and we do not doubt, but
the species are as numerous, as those of Tillandsia. The cultivation of
all the species is perfectly easy, as they require no particular soil,
or management, if kept in the hot-house; where they grow luxuriantly and
throw out, from the roots, abundance of suckers; which should be taken
off, to encourage the flowering of the central shoot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>We now exhibit a plant which may, perhaps, be known by many, under the
name of Portulaca, rather than that of Talinum. But, as the adoption of
this new formed genus, upon a division of the species which have
capsules of a different construction, from the old generic character of
Portulaca, seems generally to obtain, amongst modern botanists; such as
Jussieu, Cavanilles, Willdenow, &amp;c. we shall not dissent; although we,
at the same time, take the liberty to say, from the particular tendency
of the old genus Portulaca, to vary in most parts of the flower, both as
to number and character, we have taken up the present genus, but
reluctantly. This plant is a native of the West Indies, and is, by some,
considered as an annual; whilst by others it is treated of as a shrub;
but, indeed, it partakes of both characters, in some measure; for the
stem generally decays down, near to the earth, and often the whole plant
dies, after flowering. It grows to the height of two feet, half of which
is formed of the flower-stem. It makes a very gay appearance about
August, and seeds abundantly. Our figure was taken from a plant in the
collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore; where it flowers, annually,
in the highest perfection. Introduced, says the Kew Catalogue, by
Chevalier Murray, in the year 1776.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> pretty Geranium is rather a delicate plant, and must be kept very
dry in the winter; as, from the situation of its branches, which are
pressed to the earth, and rather fleshy, they will be very apt to rot,
if loo often watered, or placed in a damp part of the green house. It
was introduced in the year 1781, by G. Hibbert, Esq. in whose
collection, only, we have as yet seen it. Mr. Allen informs us, that it
is to be propagated as well by cuttings, as from the seeds, which it
does not produce plentifully. It has the appearance, if we may judge by
analogy, to be but a biennial, and not an abiding plant. It flowers in
April and May, and should be planted in light rich earth.</p>

<p>Here we have a botanical treat for the learned, who have adopted the new
arrangement of this very vagarious tribe; for in this one plant are
united some of the most essential characters of the three L’Heritierian
Genera, which, justly, formed but divisions of Linnæus’s original genus;
agreeing with Geranium and Erodium in the nectariferous cup; with
Pelargonium in the blossom and seed; but differing from all three, in
having but four fertile chives, with six abortive ones. A fact
ascertained by the examination of above fifty flowers, taken from four
different plants.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1789 this very fine species of Moræa was introduced to
our gardens by the late, elegantly tasted Mrs. North, lady to the Right
Hon. the Lord Bishop of Winchester; to whose fervor and liberality in
botanical pursuits we owe much of the present prevailing taste for the
science. The plant was brought to England by the Hon. Mr. F. North, on
his return from Portugal; the only remnant of a number, which he had
procured from the gardens of the late Queen of Portugal; immediately on
its arrival it was consigned, in a very sickly state, to the care of
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, who had the good fortune to
recover it.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Brazils, flowers about July or August, propagates
itself by suckers, which it makes from the root, should be planted in
light rich earth, and should be treated as a tender hot-house plant. The
leaves grow frequently to the length of two feet, or more; forming the
appearance of a large fan; the flower-stem proceeding from nearly the
centre. The flowers surpass, in delicacy and beauty of pencilling, any
of this very handsome tribe, and are as transitory as beautiful, their
duration being but of six hours, at most. It seldom happens that more
than one flower is open at a time; but the plant from which our drawing
was made, in 1797, at the Right Hon. the Marquis of Blandford’s, then
resident at Bill Hill, Berks, was in the highest perfection we have ever
hitherto seen it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> pretty little plant was first found by Masson and Thunberg, when on
their journey together in the interior of the country of the Cape of
Good Hope, and was named by Thunberg after Professor Falk of
Petersburgh. It was introduced to the Kew gardens in the year 1774. Much
as it resembles Convolvulus, it still has a greater affinity to Nolana
in all its outward parts, but especially in the cup of the flower, and
the situation and character of the seeds. Although the plant is not
shrubby, the stems, which are wiry, do not die down in winter, but take
root, if laid close to the earth. It is encreased by parting the roots
in May; should be planted in sandy loam, and kept in the green-house,
where it will blossom in July or August. Our figure is from a plant
which flowered in the collection of J. Vere, Esq. Kensington Gore.</p>

<p>It is rather singular that the indefatigable, and generally accurate,
Willdenow, should have continued this plant in the sixth class, when he
had such authority, as may be found, page 325, Vol. I, in the Catalogue
of the Kew Garden (where it unquestionably has flowered) for the removal
of it to its proper one, the fifth. It is true, he had reason to
suppose, that no man would be rash enough to form a new Genus, without a
due examination of the plant, on which he grounds his authority; and
that, as Thunberg had discovered and named it, his authority was
sufficient, and of greater weight than any other. But, unfortunately, in
this instance, for the transcriber, the describer has been mistaken, and
has led his followers into error. Indeed, the whole plant in its habit
and character has so little affinity to any hexandrous genus, that,
although Thunberg might have found a single flower, or even a whole
plant, whose flowers had six chives (a circumstance we have not been
able to discover, upon an examination of the flowers from four different
plants), in such a case, as a botanist, he ought to have looked farther,
before he made so violent a decision; and Willdenow ought to have taken
it for granted the alteration would not have been made, but upon due
consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

height of seven feet; it having been planted in the conservatory of the
Clapham collection, where it flowered, for the first time, this year, in
July, continuing in high beauty near two months. It is a plant of most
difficult increase, rarely that it is to be propagated by cuttings; and
the wood rots, if laid into the earth. A light soil, of sandy peat, and
a small portion of sandy loam, appears most congenial to its growth.
There are hopes, from the perfect state of the cones, that ripe seeds
may be procured in this country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

in this, is yellowish, and in that, it is white with a dark eye. It is
rather a delicate bulb; and to make it flower, should be kept in the
hot-house, where, it will blossom about May or June. Our drawing was
made from a plant which had been received, from the Cape, by Mr.
Hibbert, the preceding year, 1800; and we much fear, what has been said
of the great-flowered species, may be considered as referential also to
this; viz. that the bulbs never flower, but the first year after
importation. We have not been able to trace the appearance of a flower,
from any of the bulbs, this year, which has led us to this conjecture;
indeed, many of the species of this genus have this character; more
particularly, those from Africa.</p>

distinctive character of this genus, can hardly be thought of sufficient
moment to that end. As we have found it, we leave it; but could not
refrain from the foregoing remark, as it appears so singular, that
amongst so many who have published the plant, not one should have
discovered the surrounding nectary, or honey-cup, to the mouth of the
blossom, and the long threads at the end of the tips; two such very
powerful features, which distinguish Nerium, from all the rest of this
natural order.</p>

<p>It is a native of Jamaica, Cuba, and Domingo; grows to the height of
thirty feet, and is considered as a timber tree in those islands. The
whole plant is full of a milky juice, similar to what is found in most

hot-house plant; may be increased by cuttings; flowers in August, and
should be planted in rich earth.</p>

the genus we have as yet seen, and certainly one of the most beautiful.
All the species, from the Cape, are very liable to rot from damps, in
the winter; they should be kept on an airy, dry shelf, as near the glass
as possible, during the foggy months. They, in general, ripen seeds with
us, but are with difficulty increased by cuttings; which should be made

scattered over it; they are white, and deeply cut in the border, which
is rather inclined to spread. It is increased by layers; the berries
seldom ripening in England. A light, sandy peat soil, with a small
portion of loam, is the fittest for its growth; and it acquires a higher
degree of beauty, when sheltered from the scorching rays of the sun, in

<p>In the year 1789, this species of Protea was first raised from seeds;
received at the Hammersmith nursery from Vienna; they having been
collected for the Emperor’s gardens at Schonbrun, and from thence
transmitted to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy. Many plants have since been
raised, in different collections; and our present figure was made, from
a fine specimen, in the Hibbertian collection. It is rather delicate
when young, but not easily destroyed when grown to a foot in height. It
will attain to five or six feet, and makes a very pretty appearance,
when in full flower. It may be propagated by cuttings, but with
difficulty, and must be planted in light yellow loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

(the other species) were introduced, in the year 1774, to the Kew
Gardens, by Mr. F. Masson, from the Cape of Good Hope. Mons. L’Heritier,
when in England, procured drawings of both species, and figured them in
his Sertum Anglicum, tab. 15 and 16, under the names of Amaryllis
cylindracea, and A. umbrella: but, as we have had formerly occasion to
mention our objections, in following that gentleman in his alterations
of accepted Genera, in this country; we have, in the present instance,
chose rather the authority of Martyn, Curtis, Willdenow, &amp;c. in
preference; who all have followed the Kew Catalogue in the name of this
Genus. It is true, Thunberg, in his Prodromus Plantarum Capensium, P. 1.
p. 59, has it still under the Genus, Crinum; and, as Crinum pendulum,
our present subject, was known for many years. It is a very scarce
plant, and is to be found but in few collections; the increase being
only from the root, and the importation of the bulbs has been but
seldom. The seeds do not come to maturity with us, of this species;
although those of the C. angustifolius are constantly perfected. It must
be treated as a dry stove plant, or kept on a shelf in the hot-house;
should be planted in sandy loam, and have plenty of room in the pot.
Flowers in July and August.</p>

<p>From the choice collection of Joseph Cowper, Esq. of Clapton, we were
obligingly favoured with the plant, from which this figure was taken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

characters to constitute a distinct species. It has not as yet been
increased, we believe, in Britain; any attempt, to that end, has
hitherto proved abortive; from which circumstance the plants are at
present scarce, and are to be found in few collections. The same
treatment to preserve, and render the plant flourishing, is required for
this, as for the other species. Our Drawing was made in 1801, at the

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> plant, a native of the Island of Cuba, was imported from thence, by
Mr. J. Fraser, King’s Road, Chelsea, in the year 1801. It is,
unquestionably, as handsome a plant as any at present cultivated in our
hot-houses, and its continuing to produce fresh umbels of flowers,
during at least nine months of the year, renders it, perhaps, the most
desirable. It grows to the height of near three feet, producing but few
branches. The leaves are extremely irregular in their form, and, when
the plant is in a sickly state, the older ones are subject to be
slightly blotched, on the under side. Few tropical plants that thrive
with so little heat, or care; nevertheless, we have not any hopes, of
its ever becoming a proper subject for the green-house; but as yet our
experience on that point will not permit us to decide upon it. It should
be planted in a mixture of leaf mould, rotten dung, and loam; and may be
propagated by cuttings. From a plant at the Hammersmith nursery, ripe
seeds have been procured this year; they have the exact appearance of
the seeds of the lesser Palma Christi, but rather smaller in size and
have the same oily character. Indeed, there is so little difference
between some species of the Genus Ricinus, and Jatropha, that botanists
have been puzzled where to place them. Our drawing was made from a plant
in the collection of the Right Hon. the Marquis of Blandford, White
Knights, Berkshire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span></p>

as yet, acquainted, of this extensive genus. Already, we have drawings
of 22; and many more, certainly, there are, even in this kingdom; but we
shall content ourselves with figuring, in the Bot. Rep. 3 or 4, of the
most curious. One of the varieties of this plant, has been in
cultivation with us since the year 1757, when it was raised by Mr.
Miller from Cape seeds. The one represented in our present figure, was
received, from Holland, in the year 1794, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
Hammersmith; it is one of the hardiest, and surest flowering varieties
of the species; for there are but few of them which blossom freely. The
bulbs should be planted in sandy peat, about October, and taken into the
hot-house, or placed on a hot-bed, in January, to encourage a rapid and
early growth; by which means, they are more frequently induced to throw
out their flower stems the beginning of April, which otherwise, often
prove abortive. The roots should not be removed from the pots, till the
leaves are somewhat decayed.</p>

we cannot refrain from joining in opinion with the late Mr. Curtis that
it approaches as near Ixia, as Gladiolus; for the Ixia rubro-cyanea of
the Bot. Mag. is but a variety of this species. But we cannot so readily
<i>baboonify</i> our senses, with trifling changes, as to think, with a
modern reforming author, that a new genus was necessary, in this
instance, to rectify this part of the Species Plantarum, of the

appearance, are finely edged with a light pink, and are slightly waved.
It is propagated by cuttings, should be planted in light sandy loam, and

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Gigantic Swallow-wort, a native of the East Indies, is a very tender
hot-house plant; is very subject to lose its leaves in winter, and
requires the assistance of the bark-bed to keep it in perfection. In the
Kew Catalogue, it is said to have been cultivated so long ago as the
year 1690, at the Royal Gardens, Hampton Court. To render it vigorous
and flourishing, it should be planted in rich earth; composed of, one
half rotten dung, and the other leaf mould and loam; and watered but
sparingly in winter. It is seldom propagated but from seeds, which are
frequently procured from the East, and as often from the West Indies. In
the island of Jamaica, it is known by the name of the Auricula tree,
where it attains to the height of six or seven feet. Our drawing was
taken from a most magnificent specimen, obligingly sent us by Mrs.
Methuen, (of which our figure represents but a small side bunch),
measuring above a foot in diameter. The plant, we believe the finest in
England, is in the collection of Paul Methuen, Esq. Corsham, Wilts.</p>

<p>Much as we are inclined to tread in the beaten path of our predecessors,
and, more particularly, that of the greatest luminary of this intricate
science, Linnæus, yet can we, but with regret, forbear an alteration we
think so necessary, in the classification of this genus. That the class
Gynandria may, or ought to be excluded from the twenty-four, we shall
not be forward to give our suffrage, in conjunction with some modern
reformers; and, as they term themselves, improvers upon the Linnæan
system; but, whilst it is retained, this genus has stronger claims, in
our opinion, upon it, than any which has hitherto been thrown to it.
Indeed we had so classed it, upon such grounds had formed its generic
character; and had hopes, no one would have disputed our position as
just, upon an inspection of the dissections annexed to the figure. Yet
fearing, by some, it might be considered as a perplexing innovation; for
innovation in all cases is certainly more or less so, the genus having
passed the scrutinising ordeal of so many botanists; we have,
reluctantly, for the present, given up what, nevertheless, we shall
consider as necessary for some bolder hand than ourselves to undertake.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p>

Number of New Holland Botany, page 23. But the total difference in the
habit of the plant, except in the shape of the flowers, has induced us
to give it a specific title. It grows to the height of five or six feet,
not very bushy; abounding through the whole year in a succession of
flowers, which proceed from the young branches; ripe seed being produced
upon the plant at the same time. It should be planted in light sandy
peat, and kept in a dry part of the green-house, as the younger branches
are apt to suffer from damps in the months of December and January. Our
drawing was made at the Hammersmith nursery, in the year 1800, about the

<p>About the year 1786, this plant was sent by Mr. F. Masson, to the royal
gardens at Kew; as we find it in the catalogue of that collection.
Nevertheless a single plant of it was not to be found in any of our
botanic gardens, for these few years back; until the recent introduction
of it, by Mr. Niven, to the Hibbertian Collection in 1789. It is a very
delicate shrub; grows to the height of eighteen inches; branching but
little, and producing mostly two flowers at the termination of each
branch. It may be increased by cuttings, or from the seed, which ripens
in this country; but, like most of the species of this genus, it is not
a long lived plant. It approves most of a light sandy peat, with a small
mixture of loam; and to be kept in rather a small pot, in proportion to
the general size used for plants of the same bigness. Flowers in July.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

Lady Ann Monson, whose enthusiasm, in pursuing the study of natural
history, knew no bounds; and whose liberal and fostering hand
contributed more, perhaps, than any of her cotemporaries, by her
encouragement and example, to the then incipient, but now so prevailing
taste for the study of Botany.</p>

<p>The Monsonias are all natives of the Cape of Good Hope; are rather
herbaceous plants than shrubs, at least, those generally denominated
such; for although the Geranium spinosum has been given to this genus,
we have our doubts whether it ought not to remain with Geranium. They
are hardy green-house plants, flower in the months of July and August;
are propagated by the cutting small portions from the roots; and should
be planted in a mixture of sandy peat and loam. This species was
introduced by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy in the year 1788. Our drawing was
made from a plant in the Hibbertian collection..</p>

<p>It is rather strange that Thunberg in the second part of his Prod.
Plant. Cap. published in 1800; and Wildenow in his Spec. Plant. volume
the third, part 1, published the same year, should both, in the
classification of this genus rather wish to alter its class, as Schreber
and Cavanilles had done before them, than give it, in their works, under
the class and title where it was originally placed, by the founder of
the genus; or take it up on the authority of the catalogue of the plants
in the Kew gardens; where, unquestionably, two species, at least, had
flowered antecedent to the publication of that work. But indeed both of
them, have so jumbled the different synonims which they have adapted to
the three species known at present in our gardens under the names of M.
speciosa, M. lobata, and M. filia, that it is nearly impossible to
recognize in either publication the different plants under the
charactered titles they bear with us. As for Thunberg, he has thrown
them all to Geranium, under new specific names: and thus, has made his
alteration complete. Wildenow indeed has but changed the class, and
altered one specific title; but by new naming that which is our M.
speciosa he has been obliged to give the name of speciosa to our present
plant, and place the specific <i>filia</i>, as given by Linnæus to this, as a
synonim to M. lobata, upon the authority of Cavanilles; who, we must
presume, had never seen more than dried specimens of any species of this
genus. But however, we shall not pretend to clear up the bewildered
state, in which we there find this tribe of plants; or attempt to throw
any farther light on a subject that seems to have been, short as it is,
a complete puzzle to two such eminent botanists; but merely state our
ideas, that we think these plants were sufficiently well arranged under
the first assumed class, and equally readily to be known by their old
specific titles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

Mr. Williams, Nurseryman, of Turnham Green. The only living specimen in
Britain, we believe, of this plant, is at present in the Hammersmith
collection. As yet no increase has been produced from it, either by
cuttings, or seeds; for although the plant flowers every year, and the
seeds in the cone, or rather flower-cup, seem perfect, they never
vegetate. It is a hardy, and handsome growing Protea, requiring little
attention, and may be placed in any part of the green-house; grows about
three feet high, very bushy, and flowers near the month of October.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

and may be increased by cuttings; should be planted in very sandy peat
earth, and kept in a small pot proportionally to its size. Our figure

<p>As a fine variety of the Bundle-leaved Everlasting flower, figured in
this work, Pl. 242 of this Vol.; we now present this plant to our
friends. Tis true, it may be thought by some, at first sight, there is
too considerable a degree of similitude in the plants to deserve a
particular plate for each; but, upon a nigh investigation, it will be
found there exists a stronger marked difference, in the growth of the
plants, than, at first, meets the eye; not certainly enough to
constitute a specific difference, but undoubtedly a strong variety. The
flower stems, in this, grow more straddling; and the long stem-leaves
are more dispersed on the upper part of the plant; at the base they
nearly resemble each other. We have our figure from the Clapham
Collection, to which the plants were introduced at the same time, and
through the same channel as the above cited species; seeds of both
having been sent from the Cape of Good Hope, by Mr. Niven, in the year
1799. For all that relates to the management of this, we most refer our
readers to the figure just alluded to; as its habits, time of flowering,
&amp;c. in nothing differ.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

until it flowered, was considered as a species of <i>Conchium</i>, (one of
the Genera made by Dr. Smith from Banksia,) as nighest in appearance to
some species of that Genus. It has flowered, for the first time in
England, in the month of October, 1802. The plant being set in the
conservatory at the Hammersmith-Nursery, the flowers have continued to
succeed each other, progressively, upon the young branches, without
intermission, as the shoot grows, from the base of each leaf. It is with
great difficulty raised by cuttings; but, from every appearance, seed
will be procured in this country; as the seed-buds have already become
pretty large, and seeds of the other species have matured with us. It
was first raised from seed, communicated by Colonel Paterson, from Port
Jackson, New South Wales, in the year 1795. Sandy loam, or a mixture of
sandy peat and loam, is the soil it most approves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p>

<p>Although little can be said in favour of the flowers of this plant, yet
the singularity of its foliage excites our attention, as very distinct
from all its congeners. It grows with us to the height of six or seven
feet; at which size, it produces its blossoms. The first plants were
raised from seeds in the year 1787 at the garden of the late Dr.
Pitcairne at Islington. It is increased by cuttings, after the usual
mode made use of for propagating Botany Bay plants; that is to say, by
placing the cuttings in the heat of a hot-house, or hot-bed, early in
the month of March, till they are rooted. It is a hardy green-house
plant when old, but rather delicate when young. Our figure was began
from a plant in the Hibbertian collection, which flowered in the month
of August, 1800; and finished from one at the Hammersmith Nursery, in
November, 1802. A short apology may be thought necessary for our
retaining the original mode of terminating the name of this Genus,
rather than as it is given by most authors at present. Our plea is that
only of priority, and the name under which the plants have been known,
in our gardens, these 30 years; since, indeed, Sir J. Banks’s return
from the South Seas. A slight mistake we wish likewise to notice, in the
etymology of the word Metrosideros, as given by Dr. Martyn in his
edition of Miller’s Dictionary; it is there said to be thus derived,
Μητρα, medulla, the heart or pith of a tree, and σιδηρος iron; supposing
the heart of the trees to possess the hardness, or colour of iron. Now
the true idea on which the name of the Genus was founded, is the shape
and hardness of the seed-vessel, thus; Μετρον a measure, and σιδηρος
iron, as the appearance of the capsule, when ripe, will fully justify.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span></p>

<p>Our figure represents the Moræa Ferrariola of Jacquin’s Collectanea 4.
p. 141; but, as we conceive Ferraria a good, and distinct genus, we have
not followed either him, or Thunberg, who has likewise thrown these
plants to Moræa. At first sight we did not think this plant possessed of
sufficient distinctive character to be treated as a different species
from the F. undulata; but upon closer inspection found it to vary nearly
in every part; in the shape of the flower, the leaves and the root. The
singular character of this, and the other Cape Ferrarias, of making but
one growth in two, and sometimes three years; is hardly to be traced in
any other plants, but constantly so in these. They produce their flowers
about July, the season of their flowering; the flowers are as transitory
as those of the F. pavonia; that is to say, the duration of about six
hours. Our figure was taken from a plant in the Hibbertian Collection,
which flowered in the month of July 1802. The Ferrarias all propagate by
the root; and should be planted in sandy peat mixed with a small portion
of loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

to Britain, in the year 1792, having been raised from seeds communicated
by Col. Paterson, then stationed on that Island. It attains the height
of 13 feet, or more, becoming a small tree; may be increased readily
from cuttings, and should be planted in a mixture of loam and sandy
peat. Our figure is from a specimen received from the Right Hon. Lord
Viscount Courtenay, in whose collection at Powderham, near Exeter, it
flowered for the first time in the year 1800; and where also the seeds
ripened.</p>

<p>We have no doubt but this plant belongs to the Genus Lagunæa, of
Schreber; but as he proposes himself, and as L’Heritier as justly
observes, the simplicity of the cup is not a sufficient ground, on which
to found a new genus; so we have rather given our present subject, the
name under which it is in general known, than adopt a title for it which
is acknowledged by the author, as rather unwarrantable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">To</span> the Right Hon. the Earl of Coventry we are indebted for the figure of
this superb plant; it having flowered in his Lordship’s rich, and
extensive collection at Croome, Worcestershire, this present February,
1803, for the first time, in England; his Lordship did us the favour to
order the flower to be cut, and sent to London; where it arrived,
without the least injury, and continued in perfection many days.</p>

<p>The magnificence of this species of Protea, can be but poorly expressed
within the limited bounds of our publication; we have, nevertheless,
endeavoured to do it all the justice within our grasp. A considerable
part of the lustre of the flower is lost, from the small portion of the
leaves which could be introduced; as the contrasted beauty of the fine
broad shining leaves, which form, as it were, a nidus, or ground wood
for the blossom, contribute, so much, to heighten the beauty of the
whole.</p>

<p>The Protea cynaroides is a hardy greenhouse plant, was introduced to
Britain, in 1792, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, from the Cape
of Good Hope. May be increased by cuttings, taken off the lower part of
the plant; where they shoot out in clusters to the length of an inch or
more, and must be treated as has already been directed for Proteas in
general. The plant, even at the Cape, seldom grows higher than 18
inches, or two feet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span></p>
